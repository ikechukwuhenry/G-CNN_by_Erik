        # The input `a` and `b` must be tuples containing two integers, e.g. `a = (f, r)`.
        # The two integeres indicate whether the group element includes a reflection and the number of rotations.
        # The method should return the tuple representing the product of the two input elements.
        # You should also check that the inputs are valid.
